# 🏡 House Price Prediction - Machine Learning Project

Welcome to the **House Price Prediction** project! This project uses **machine learning (regression)** to predict property prices based on various factors. I built this from scratch, including data cleaning, model training, backend development, and a website frontend.

## 🌟 Features
- 📊 **Data Cleaning**: Cleaned the dataset to handle missing values and outliers.
- 🤖 **Model Training**: Trained the machine learning model using regression techniques.
- 🔗 **Backend**: Developed using Flask to serve the model predictions.
- 💻 **Frontend**: Created a responsive website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to display the predictions.

## 🚀 Technologies Used
- **Python** (Machine Learning & Data Handling)
- **Flask** (Backend)
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript** (Frontend)
- **Pandas, NumPy** (Data Cleaning)
- **Scikit-learn** (Model Training)
